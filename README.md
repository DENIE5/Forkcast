## 🔧 How It Works

The program stores arrays of meals for each category (e.g., Beef, Chicken, Pasta). When you run the program, it will:

1. **Generate a random meal** 🍲 for each category (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Lamb, Fish, Pasta, Soup).
2. **Display the meals** 📜 in a formatted way for easy reading.
3. Allow you to **reroll meals** 🔄 by prompting you if you want to try a different set of random meals.
